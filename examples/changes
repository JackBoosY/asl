Sun May 16 12:21:33 EDT 1993
  Add arg need_stub to getstub.c (==> changes to getstub.h, mng.c, nl2.c).
  Change %ld to %d in some format strings in lin1.c and lin2.c.
  New variant linrc.c of lin1.c that uses names from stub.row and stub.col
file if available.

Sun Jun 20 08:59:19 EDT 1993
  Many minor changes, plus new sample input and output files.
Postscript for "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL" is now available
as "93-10 from research/nam".

Wed Jun 30 23:46:08 EDT 1993
  Postscript for "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL" (available as
"93-10 from research/nam") updated to describe new ordering of
nonlinear variables and counts in .nl files that describe
nonlinear integer variables.

Thu Sep  2 07:52:54 EDT 1993
  nl2.c: fix bug in loop that checks for bounds on variables:
<	for(i = j = 0; i < N;  i++)
---
>	for(i = j = 0; i < P;  i++)

Thu Nov 18 08:39:21 EST 1993
  README: comments about ftp updated.

Wed Feb 22 10:20:23 EST 1995
  dualconv.c: add #ifdef KR_headers stuff for K&R C compilers.
  linrc.c: minor adjustment to permit compilation on non-Unix systems
(such as MS-DOS).

Mon Apr 21 22:45:29 EDT 1997
  Update for revised amplsolver.a and "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL".

Thu Aug 14 00:19:57 EDT 1997
  Update MATLAB interface files amplfunc.c and spamfunc.c for MATLAB
5.x, renaming the old MATLAB 4.x versions amplfun4.c and spamfun4.c.

Thu Mar 26 22:22:02 EST 1998
  Trivial tweaks to ve08.c (we know that nerror >= 0).
  amplfunc.c, spamfunc.c: new optional 7th left-hand (return) argument
to amplfunc('stub') and spamfunc('stub'): the cvar array: if positive,
cvar(i) is the subscript of the variable (in 1..length(x)) that
complements constraint i.
  evalg.m: minor correction: initialize j = 0.
  makefile: adjust to reflect funcadd1.c in the parent (solvers)
directory.

Fri Mar 27 15:49:25 EST 1998
  Adjust makefiles to reflect addition of funcadd1.o to ../amplsolver.a.

Wed Apr 15 14:33:56 EDT 1998
  Adjust amplfunc.c, enewt.m, rvmsg.c, savesol.m, spamfunc.c, tnmain.c,
and ve08.c to return solve_result to AMPL (by assigning solve_result_num);
minor tweak to solve message format by solvers "v8" and "ve08".

Tue Jul 14 15:52:34 EDT 1998
  linrc.c: compute clen and rlen (which matters if constraint or
variable names exceed 8 characters in length).
  Cosmetic change to amplfunc.c and spamfunc.c that eliminates a
pointless warning message by some compilers.

Wed Jul 29 09:32:15 EDT 1998
  README: add table of possible solve_result_num values for mng, mnh, nl2.

Fri Apr  9 00:46:03 EDT 1999
  dualconv.c: set asl->i.n_var0 and asl->i.n_con0, which became
necessary after changes for declared suffixes.

Thu Apr 15 16:25:02 EDT 1999
  makefile and various .out files: add 2>&1 to various test invocation
lines.  On Microsoft systems, amplsolv.lib merges stderr with stdout,
and this change makes the output files agree.
