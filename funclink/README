Sometimes it is convenient to use user-defined functions (usually
written in C, C++, or Fortran 77) within an AMPL session or in the
optimization problems that AMPL sends to solvers.  On most systesm
(including Windows 95 and Windows NT, but excluding MS-DOS), it is
convenient to provide user-defined functions in a shared library (also
known, on some systems, as a dynamic-link library or DLL).  This
directory provides system-dependent details on creating suitable
shared libraries.

The student versions of AMPL do not have facilities for getting
user-defined functions from shared libraries.  Commercial versions of
AMPL may offer these facilities -- to make them available, the AMPL
vendor must link the AMPL binary appropriately.  Similarly, solvers
must be appropriately linked to import functions from shared
libraries.  The makefiles in this directory provide system-dependent
details on linking solvers this way.

The same shared library can make user-defined functions available both
to AMPL and to solvers.  Solvers currently can only use deterministic
functions that return numeric values.  Within AMPL, user-defined
functions can also be "symbolic", i.e., return strings, and be
"random", i.e., can return different values when given the same
arguments.  When a shared library that provides some deterministic
numeric-valued functions and some symbolic or random functions is used
with a solver, the symbolic or random functions are automatically
ignored -- the solver does not see them.

File funcadd.c contains sample user-defined functions, both
deterministic numeric functions (which can be used by both AMPL and
solvers), and symbolic or random functions (which only AMPL can use).

File funcaddk.c is a K&R version of funcadd.c.  Source files in the
AMPL/solver interface library normally contain "#ifdef KR_headers"
lines to permit compilation by a K&R compiler (when compiled with
-DKR_headers); for readability, funcadd.c and funcaddk.c depart from
this practice and are separate files.

To use user-defined functions written in Fortran, it is necessary
to call them from a C (or C++) "wrapper".

The makefile.* files are makefile variants for various systems;
see the comments in them.  The "S =" lines in the makefiles assume
this directory is a subdirectory of ampl/solvers.

If appropriately linked versions of AMPL and solvers are invoked
in a directory that has a suitable library of user-defined functions,
they use that library.  Otherwise they use an installation-dependent
default library that on many systems makes no user-defined functions
available.  Source file funcadd0.c (in ampl/solvers) may be used in
creating this dummy libarary.  The policy of looking in the current
directory for a shared library seems convenient, but could be viewed
as a security risk; feel free to make other arrangements.  Many
systems have a shell variable that controls where the system looks
for shared libraries; comments in the makefiles give the details.

For use with appropriately linked AMPL processors, silly.x is an AMPL
input script that invokes the functions in funcadd.c .

See the comments in funcadd.c, $S/funcadd.h, and silly.x.

After you have issued the appropriate make command to create a
library of the sample user-defined functions linked in,

invoking

	ampl silly.x >silly.out 2>silly.2

in this directory should give sample output files silly.out and silly.2 .

File htest.x illustrates using the user-defined function hypot (in the
sample funcadd.c) with solver "minosu" (a minos variant that obtains
imported functions from a shared library).  File htest.out is from

	ampl htest.x >htest.out
